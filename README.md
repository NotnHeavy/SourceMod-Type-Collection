# SourceMod Type Collection

This is basically just a dump of random methodmaps that I decided to make over time. Yes, that includes CUtlVector, all of your sins in one methodmap. Have fun!

## How to use
You can just drag over random header files from here and add them to your own project. 

At the very least, you'll need [Scags' SM-Memory Extension](https://github.com/Scags/SM-Memory). Every .inc makes use of "Pointer.inc" as well, which is pretty much the barebones methodmap for each type.
